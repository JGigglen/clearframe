# Clearframe UI Language — v0

## YES Intervention (Active Bias)

"Clearframe detected a reasoning pattern that often leads to poor outcomes.

This decision appears to rely on past investment (time, effort, or resources)
as justification for a future action.

Past investment is unrecoverable.
The decision’s quality depends on expected future value.

Counterfactual framing:
If this situation were presented to you today with no prior investment,
what evidence would justify continuing from this point forward?"

---

## SOFT Intervention (Ambiguous / Self-Aware)

"You’re already examining whether past investment is influencing this decision.

A useful check:
If none of the past effort could be recovered,
would your reasoning about next steps change?"

---

## NO Intervention (Bias Neutralized)

(no message shown)

Optional on request:
"This reasoning evaluates the decision independently of past investment."








                notes
                Ask yourself:

Does it feel calm?

Does it feel respectful?

Would you accept this mid-decision?

If yes → it’s right.
