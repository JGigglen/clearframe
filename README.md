# Clearframe

Clearframe is a system that detects when human reasoning is distorted under pressure
and reframes decisions before commitment.

## Core Principle
Clearframe does not give advice.
It identifies cognitive patterns and presents counterfactual frames.
The user always decides.

## v0 Scope (Locked)
- Input: user-submitted decision or reasoning
- Detects ONE bias only: Sunk Cost Fallacy
- Explains why the bias may apply
- Presents one counterfactual framing
- No recommendations, no enforcement

## Why This Exists
Humans make predictable reasoning errors under pressure.
Clearframe acts as decision hygiene, not control.

## Status
v0 – manual prompt-driven prototype
